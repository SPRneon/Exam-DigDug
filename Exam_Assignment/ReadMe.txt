DIG DUG
PROGRAMMING 4 ASSIGNMENT 2019 

This is my attempt at recreating the Dig Dug game from Namco.
It has 2 modes. The first ebing 1 player where you take control of the 'digger'.
The goal is to defeat all the enemies in the level.
It is also possible for a 2nd player to take control of 1 of the Fygar.
Together the 2 players can then defeat the other enemies.
